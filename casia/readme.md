### The Virtual Simulated dataset (with generated two-classes neuron data)

One class is pyramidal type neuron, another is basket type neuron. Each class contains 500 samples. 

construct_neuron: The new neuron type generation. 

cluster: The clustering of neurons based on hand-designed features from trees-tools. 

dataset: contain 100 demo neuron samples generated by construct_neuron method.

feature detection: A simple test for the feature generation. 

swc2img: The tool for convert the SWC-format file into the 2D image.
